## Group-specific settings:
# groupID : Group's identifier. Used as the prefix of host names
# nrofHosts: number of hosts in the group
# transmitRange: range of the hosts' radio devices (meters)
# transmitSpeed: transmit speed of the radio devices (bytes per second)
# movementModel: movement model of the hosts (valid class name from movement package)
# waitTime: minimum and maximum wait times (seconds) after reaching destination
# speed: minimum and maximum speeds (m/s) when moving on a path
# bufferSize: size of the message buffer (bytes)
# router: router used to route messages (valid class name from routing package)
# activeTimes: Time intervals when the nodes in the group are active (start1, end1, start2, end2, ...)
# msgTtl : TTL (minutes) of the messages created by this host group, default=infinite

## Group and movement model specific settings
# pois: Points Of Interest indexes and probabilities (poiIndex1, poiProb1, poiIndex2, poiProb2, ... ) - for ShortestPathMapBasedMovement
# okMaps : which map nodes are OK for the group (map file indexes), default=all - for all MapBasedMovent models
# routeFile: route's file path - for MapRouteMovement
# routeType: route's type - for MapRouteMovement
